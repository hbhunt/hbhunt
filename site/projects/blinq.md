BLINQ lets shoppers save big on excess and returned inventory.

### Role

As the lead designer on BLINQ.com, I was responsible a variety of projects to improve the customer experience and add new features to the site.

## Homepage Redesign

### Problems to solve
* The existing BLINQ homepage featured a hero banner and a series of carousels with merchandise organized by category. There was nothing to differentiate BLINQ or to explain why merchandise prices were so low.
* The existing BLINQ homepage had very little space for promotions, seasonal items, or other time-sensitive content; this meant customers had little reason to come back and the BLINQ marketing team was hamstrung in their efforts to highlight seasonal and timely products.
* The current homepage does not work for mobile visitors.

I worked closely with a product manager to wireframe various homepage layouts that could address the growing needs of both BLINQ customers and the internal BLINQ team.

**Responsive Homepage**
I designed the BLINQ homepage mobile-first to ensure that the ~45% of mobile visitors had a first-class experience.
