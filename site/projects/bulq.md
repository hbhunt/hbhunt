BULQ has supplied **thousands** of resellers with **millions** of dollars worth of inventory to power their businesses.

### Process &amp; Role

* **Concept** – I worked closely with a branding consultant to interview stakeholders, survey the competitive landscape, and generate ideas for how we could bring our direct-sales business to a wider audience.
* **Empathy** I organized and lead a series of interviews with experts and existing customers to validate assumptions and discover insights. This input helped us refine our concept and decide on a set of values that would form the pillars of our brand. I lead the creation of personas that crystallized our findings and represented our core buyers.
* **Ideation** –  Working from sketches and creating storyboards, user flows, and a comprehensive set of wireframes, I lead a cross-functional team in exploring our concept in more depth and refining individual flows, screens, and layouts.
* **Prototype** –  With a critical mass of wireframes, I used InVision to create clickable prototypes to simulate the site. Working with a visual designer, I created high-fidelity wireframes which we used to build a high-fidelity prototype.
* **Testing** – By collecting feedback from customers with our prototypes, we were able to make important content and layout changes at low cost and without code changes.
* **Product Roadmap** –  Since launch, the team has added several features following a similar process. Features like new inventory notifications; smaller, lower-cost lot sizes; and new ways to search and browse through inventory have been successful for our customers and our business.

### Team
As BULQ has grown from concept into a full-fledged business, the team had grown in lockstep. It's been my privilege to have worked with everyone involved in BULQ.com, the BULQ iOS app, ecommerce operations, and BULQ marketing. A few of the roles I worked most closely with are:

* UX Lead (Me)
* Product Manager
* Development Lead
* Visual Designer
* Marketing Team
* Executive Stakeholders
