## Interview Limitations

##### [Functional Fixedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_fixedness) — people’s thinking is limited  to existing structures  

* People understand their world within a structure
* What we usually get: adding new features, fixing problems, transferring features we’ve seen elsewhere. Seldom a total redesign.
* People cannot imagine hypothetical situations
* People are happy to make something up

##### What people do *not* know about themselves

* Predicting what they would do, like, or want
* Estimating the last time they did something
* Estimating how often they do things
* How much they like things on an absolute scale

##### What people *do* know about themselves

* What they do
* How they do things
* Their opinions about their current activities
* Their complaints about their current activities
* How much they like one thing compared with another

##### Easy mistakes to make

* It’s a mistake to share your opinions — People want to please and interviewer opinions shape what people tell them.
* It’s a mistake to do all the talking — The interviewer should aim for 20-25% of total interview word count.
* They fail to follow up interviewee remarks — When inspiration fails, “Can you tell me more about that?”

## Interview Outline

### Start with high level questions and small talk about others

* What does your work organization do?
* What kinds of people work there?
* How does your family start the day?

### Then move to easy, factual questions

* Who usually gets dinner ready?
* Can you recall a restaurant meal with your family? Who was there?

### Task, roles and details of tasks

* What do you do first?
* What do you do when the deadline is soon?
* Does anything slow you down?
* What do you do when you have this trouble?

### Walk through tasks “yesterday” or most recently

* Where were you? What were you working on?
* Who else was there?
* What happened next?

### Follow-Up

* Can you describe how you select music in your car?
* Can you tell me about a time when you did that?
* Have you ever tried that and it didn’t work?
* Was that what you expected?
* Does that problem happen often?
* What does “system” mean here?
* I am hearing you say…

### Ending the Interview

* Do you have any suggestions for us, or last thoughts?
* Yes, everything we have discussed is confidential. We won’t reveal your identity to anyone.
* Thank you for talking with me. Here’s my card if you want to get in touch.

### Avoid

* Avoid describing details of your plan or design
* Avoid asking about features; ask about the underlying need that would make a feature useful
* Avoid leading people with possible answers.

## Interview Tactics

1. Repetition/Rephrase
2. Get Behind Behavior — “What were you expecting to see?”
3. Ask for an Example
4. Go Step by Step
5. Question a term or concept (even if you think you know it) — “What do you mean by `___`?”
6. Summarize what was said and draw out a conclusion or concept — “So you’re saying that `___`?”
7. Question pronoun references
8. Check for deviant cases
9. Go for generalization — “Do you often `___`?” — this is mostly to identify deviant cases, people don’t reliably know how to generalize many behaviors.
10. Clarify expectations — “You expected `___` and got `___`?”
11. Clarify activity
12. Clarity metaphors
13. Ask for a story
